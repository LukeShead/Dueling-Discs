# Dueling-Discs
This will be my Capstone project for the first year of my HND course.

## What is the Game.

Dueling Disks is a game that I will be building for my first year capstone project, it shall be a remake of retro games, it takes inspiration from games like Pong and Tron.  The objective of the game is to beat your opponent by clashing your disc at a better angle than your opponent.
Both Players will start off at either side of the screen, there will be no movement from the X or Z axis, only the Y axis will be available for the players at the start of the game. Players will move their avatar up or down, once they lock their position, they will aim their discs. 

## Map and Design,

The map will be a rectangular box to start with however if successful I will be adding obstacles within the map. 
The Players will shoot their discs across the map, depending on where they aim the discs, bounce on the different surfaces and eventually, collide, when the discs collide the winner is decided depending on the angle of impact.
The game will be made in Unity and will be played using keyboard and mouse, however there maybe future development for IOS or Android use. Because of this the game will be made with a simplistic style and theme, the pictures will be simple stickmen to start however there will different colours to help players have unique styles to their discs and avatars.

## Objective of the Game,

If the discs are facing each other and collide head on, the winner will be who has bounced the most on the two left and right borders wins the point. However, if one disc collides the side of another disc, that disc will get the point as it has struck a weak spot in the disc. The aim of the game is to get to 10 points before your opponent. 

The main aim of this project is to be able to create an enjoyable experience for any users that want to play the game that I am creating. However as much as the objectives and aims are for the user’s entertainment, it is also to help myself to gain knowledge when looking at designing and creating programs. By having this project provide an entertaining experience to the users that try it will mean that I will be able to help my reputation grow as a developer, this will mean that the future will become easier to gain clients as I will be able to refer back to programs I have made before. 

## Cost of the game

The cost for the game won’t be any money for assets as I will be making them myself and will not need a third party change as the graphics are very simple. Instead it will require a lot of time as it will take some time to make. As well as this the internet will be required to make this game as there will be a lot of research that will need to be done. Finally, Unity will be required to make this project as it is extremely helpful when creating a game, these are all costs for the project however with these means that I must use a system that can run them, because if they don’t or if there are slow it will cause problems for the development.

## Scope of the game

The scope of the project is purely shown by the features that are within the game, depending on if I decide to add any features later, the scope could be bigger however at the moment, the scope is not too big. Unity will cover a lot of the features that i will want to immplement, this will include angles as well as physics and objects, with all this the scope becomes easier to manage. The game must stay like pong in its style so the scope will be the athstetics, style and gameplay, as the features are very basic the scope of the project is managable.

## Risks for the project and the contingences

With designing and developing the project, there are many risks that can hinder the process, with each risk, a contingency must be planned in order to stop the risk from being too harmful to the process.

The first risk is the fault of hardware or software, this can mean that my home computer or unity software can have issues, as well as this my internet router or my USB can all have faults that can slow the process of development. If my PC was to stop working then it would mean that the amount of work that I can do will have a massive impact as my work that can be done as home will be stopped until it's repaired, Unity crashing would mean a reinstallment of the software which would take time to do. If the internet router was to have a fault, then I would not be able to retrieve my work as it will be saved on the cloud, also most study materials will not be able to be retrieved. This means that my work would be limited to the knowledge that I have and cannot learn more to implement more into the game.

In order to stop these risks from causing significant damage to the process, my contingences include having
