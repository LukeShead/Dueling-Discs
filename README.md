# Dueling-Discs
This will be my Capstone project for the first year of my HND course.

## What is the Game.

Dueling Disks is a game that I will be building for my first year capstone project, it shall be a remake of retro games, it takes inspiration from games like Pong and Tron.  The objective of the game is to beat your opponent by clashing your disc at a better angle than your opponent.
Both Players will start off at either side of the screen, there will be no movement from the X or Z axis, only the Y axis will be available for the players at the start of the game. Players will move their avatar up or down, once they lock their position, they will aim their discs. 


## Map and Design,

The map will be a rectangular box to start with however if successful I will be adding obstacles within the map. 
The Players will shoot their discs across the map, depending on where they aim the discs, bounce on the different surfaces and eventually, collide, when the discs collide the winner is decided depending on the angle of impact.
The game will be made in Unity and will be played using keyboard and mouse, however there maybe future development for IOS or Android use. Because of this the game will be made with a simplistic style and theme, the pictures will be simple stickmen to start however there will different colours to help players have unique styles to their discs and avatars.

# This is the General look of the game.

## Objective of the Game,

If the discs are facing each other and collide head on, the winner will be who has bounced the most on the two left and right borders wins the point. However, if one disc collides the side of another disc, that disc will get the point as it has struck a weak spot in the disc. The aim of the game is to get to 10 points before your opponent. 

The main aim of this project is to be able to create an enjoyable experience for any users that want to play the game that I am creating. However as much as the objectives and aims are for the user’s entertainment, it is also to help myself to gain knowledge when looking at designing and creating programs. By having this project provide an entertaining experience to the users that try it will mean that I will be able to help my reputation grow as a developer, this will mean that the future will become easier to gain clients as I will be able to refer back to programs I have made before. 

## Cost of the game

The cost for the game won’t be any money for assets as I will be making them myself and will not need a third party change as the graphics are very simple. Instead it will require a lot of time as it will take some time to make. As well as this the internet will be required to make this game as there will be a lot of research that will need to be done. Finally, Unity will be required to make this project as it is extremely helpful when creating a game, these are all costs for the project however with these means that I must use a system that can run them, because if they don’t or if there are slow it will cause problems for the development.

## Scope of the game

The scope of the project is purely shown by the features that are within the game, depending on if I decide to add any features later, the scope could be bigger however at the moment, the scope is not too big. Unity will cover a lot of the features that i will want to immplement, this will include angles as well as physics and objects, with all this the scope becomes easier to manage. The game must stay like pong in its style so the scope will be the athstetics, style and gameplay, as the features are very basic the scope of the project is managable.

## Risks for the project and the contingences

With designing and developing the project, there are many risks that can hinder the process, with each risk, a contingency must be planned in order to stop the risk from being too harmful to the process.

The first risk is the fault of hardware or software, this can mean that my home computer or unity software can have issues, as well as this my internet router or my USB can all have faults that can slow the process of development. If my PC was to stop working then it would mean that the amount of work that I can do will have a massive impact as my work that can be done as home will be stopped until it's repaired, Unity crashing would mean a reinstallment of the software which would take time to do. If the internet router was to have a fault, then I would not be able to retrieve my work as it will be saved on the cloud, also most study materials will not be able to be retrieved. This means that my work would be limited to the knowledge that I have and cannot learn more to implement more into the game.

In order to stop these risks from causing significant damage to the process, my contingences include having multiple computers that use unity to help if one computer has an issue, for example my home computer and the college computer. By doing this one computer having a problem will mean that the other one will be still available for use. For the internet not working it is the same with the multiple computers as if the internet is down I will be able to use the college computers to continue my work. This means that with these issues I am still able to continue my work. 

The other kind of problem I can encounter are halts in real life sitiuations, for example me getting ill or my family making plans to go away etc. These plans are very difficult to plan contingences so instead I have allocated extra time within the development stages within this stage. This should be enough to make sure that any time that is taken up by events can be accounted for and worked on.


## Feasibility Report

### Proposed Project Description:

The Project will be planned in stages and with it I will be using the Waterfall cycle for software development, this means that I will plan the whole process, from there each stage will be individually planned and completed. These individual sections will be fully completed and tested before I move onto the next stage of the process, using this method allows me to manage the project a lot better as it gives me more control over each section of the project, this means that there will be a very small risk of many bugs happening within the game as each stage will be looked at as the project is developed. This will increase the chances of having no bugs within the game as when one appears, I will be able to know exactly where the bug is located and be able to complete it before any more problems arise. 

The scope of the project will be able to be managed in a way that is safe for me, the costs of the project will be calculated as the project continues, for this some money has been put aside for resouces that are needed for the project, an estimate of £50 has been made as the project will mainly be investing time for it to be complete. The timescale of this project will span over a few months, however all dates will be in the gantt chart, they will mark the time I have for this project.

### Market Analysis Section

The game will be under the name of reboot games, from this will it be marketed and given to the public, the game will include a very minor microtransactions system that will involve athstetics for the circles, this will be very minor but can be an extra feature for people that want a bit more out of the game. Since the cost of developing the project will be a very low cost it means that the price for profit will not be very high, however the main use of this will for people to have this game for free, with this it will entice people to play it a lot more and if they want to they can buy athsetics and won't be forced to.

The game will be targeted towards children to young adults, it will be very useful for a short entertainment session so people that travel a lot will be enticed just as much as someone who is just looking to fill in some time at home.


### Technical Feasibility

With specialist resources that are required, the only resource that is more specialist is Unity which is free, however the Unity pro costs money, however the Pro has already been acquired so there isn't any special resources that are needed for now.

### Financial Feasibility Section

The implementation of the game will be very simple, it will be a downloadable application that can be downloaded from any source, I am planning on using Gamejolt or some other form of application download platform in order to implement it on user's system. The plan is to have it for PC however I will try to make a platform for android as well in order to make it easier to access. Because of this there will be no need for any costs to be able to implement it as the files can be put anyway for free.


### Software development vulnerabilities and how to reduce them


When developing software, there are many ways that it can be exploited by attackers, this can be done in many ways however the biggest way is by discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within the system, this is because it is where the software is easier to exploit. 

For example, one of the most common vulnerabilities come from user inputs, this is where the user of a system can use an input to command the software to do things that could be considered malicious such as deleting information and data stored upon the system or being able to retreive the information in order to gain profit from them. These usually will come with softwares that have a database built into them, these are known as SQL injections, these can be very dangerous for a company or team that allow this type of vulnerability to be exploited as it can lead to the DPA (Data Protection Act) being broken and the team facing a penalty for it, this can mean losing thousands of pounds in fines. This is why this type of vulnerability can be so dangerous as it is extremely easy for it to be exploited due to it being given to the user, unlike other exploits, this only requires a simple line of code to begin the exploit.

Unlike SQL injections with database input vulnerabilities, there are many different forms of vulnerabilities that can be exploited without the situational database. For example one vulnerability that is commmonly used is the amount of memory that a system can handle, every system has an amount of memory that they can use in order to complete the tasks, this means that the system can run out of memory and crash if a task that is too big for it is attempted. This is something that can be exploited on almost any system if given the opportunity, it can be something simple from a home PC to a company system. The ways to reduce this vulnerability require a lot of areas to be covered which means it is not as easy to reduce, however it is not a vulnerability that can be used to completly delete or destroy a system, the most it can do is hinder or stop a system temporarily. Because of this it is not a vulnerability that is very dangerous however it can lead to other exploits due to its ability to stop systems.

Those are just two of the many vulnerabilities that can mean that a software will be ruined
