# Dueling-Discs
This will be my Capstone project for the first year of my HND course.

## What is the Game.

Dueling Disks is a game that I will be building for my first year capstone project, it shall be a remake of retro games, it takes inspiration from games like Pong and Tron.  The objective of the game is to beat your opponent by clashing your disc at a better angle than your opponent.
Both Players will start off at either side of the screen, there will be no movement from the X or Z axis, only the Y axis will be available for the players at the start of the game. Players will move their avatar up or down, once they lock their position, they will aim their discs. 

## Map and Design,

The map will be a rectangular box to start with however if successful I will be adding obstacles within the map. 
The Players will shoot their discs across the map, depending on where they aim the discs, bounce on the different surfaces and eventually, collide, when the discs collide the winner is decided depending on the angle of impact.
The game will be made in Unity and will be played using keyboard and mouse, however there maybe future development for IOS or Android use. Because of this the game will be made with a simplistic style and theme, the pictures will be simple stickmen to start however there will different colours to help players have unique styles to their discs and avatars.

## Objective of the Game,

If the discs are facing each other and collide head on, the winner will be who has bounced the most on the two left and right borders wins the point. However, if one disc collides the side of another disc, that disc will get the point as it has struck a weak spot in the disc. The aim of the game is to get to 10 points before your opponent.
